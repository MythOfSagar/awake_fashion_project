  | Serial No            | Step                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | In home page hover on "Category" present in navbar, a dropdown will appear where click either "Women" or "Women All Brands", then it will redirect to products page|
| 2| Now add required details for signup and save then do the signin at signin feature at the same page, so upon signin you will be directed to products page, where one can sort by price by selecting sort options, so if you click on any item it will be redirected to product display page |
| 3 | Now to increase quantity you can click "+" symbol and to decrease the same click "-" and click "Add to cart" so the item will be added to your cart|
| 4 | To go cart page hover on cart icon at right corner and click "Proceed to cart" button, then change quantity by selecting "Quantity" option and to remove item from your cart click delete icon and click "Proceed to pay" for payment feature and follow the same|

  So it was a great experience to us while building this task we have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever we have learnt in our current unit. The project covers basic front end designs using React up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Prabhanjan Padhye* and also instructor associate *Rounak Mojumder* for guiding us which helpled me to feel confident and work upon the project and to complete within the specified time period.
